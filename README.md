In this project we have created a basic Pacman game, which Map of Ariel city is its game board.
The aim of this game : the player needs to eat all the fruits on the screen as fast as possible.
Each pacman has a speed of movement (in meters per second) and an eating radius (in meters) that defines proximity the minimum required for a pacman to eat his fruit.

<br>
The user gets to choose in which way he wants to build the game, place the player with a mouse click or rather to play an automatic game, which the algorithm already chose where to place the player. 
<br>
In this particular pacman game we have 4 objects on our screen:
<br>
Me – which is the main player
<br>
Pacmans – which aim is eating all the fruits in the field
<br>
Fruits – get eaten either by Me or Pacman
<br>
Ghosts– which aim is chasing Me and interrupt his game. If the ghost catches Me, his score will decrease. 
<br>
Black Rectangles– Black boxes that interrupt Me game. If Me is mistakenly invades the Black Rectangles territory, his score will decrease. 
<br>
While the game processes we made a unique Algorithm which is writing all the Me steps in a real time consideration. In addition, we calculated which way is the shortest way to the nearest fruit, we consider the Black rectangles obstacle, ghosts and pacmans.

We gathered information from: Google, YouTube for videos explanations, Stack Overflow, GeekforGeeks, Oracle for information of classes in Java (most of them for the GUI package), Yael Landau’s code for (GUI, read files and write files) and specific website below:
